Data definition & manipulation (ddl & dml)
1: creating tables with constraints (primary key, foreign key, check)
2: performing insert, update, and delete operations
3: retrieving data using select with where, order by clauses.


-- 1: Creating tables with constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Check)
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DeptID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DeptName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmpName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18),
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 3000.00,
    DeptID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

-- 2: Performing INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations
INSERT INTO Departments (DeptID, DeptName) VALUES (101, 'Engineering'), (102, 'Marketing');

INSERT INTO Employees (EmpID, EmpName, Age, Salary, DeptID) 
VALUES (1, 'Alice Johnson', 29, 75000.00, 101),
       (2, 'Bob Smith', 24, 55000.00, 102);

UPDATE Employees 
SET Salary = Salary * 1.10 
WHERE DeptID = 101;

DELETE FROM Employees 
WHERE EmpID = 2;

-- 3: Retrieving data using SELECT with WHERE and ORDER BY clauses
SELECT EmpName, Salary, Age 
FROM Employees 
WHERE Salary > 50000 AND Age < 40 
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
