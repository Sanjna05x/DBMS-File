🗄️ DBMS Practical Portfolio
SQL Experiments • Database Design • Query Practice

This repository is a personal DBMS learning portfolio created during my undergraduate coursework in Database Management Systems.
Instead of only storing lab answers, this repository reflects my step-by-step understanding of databases, SQL logic building, and structured data handling.

It represents how theoretical DBMS concepts are converted into working SQL queries.
